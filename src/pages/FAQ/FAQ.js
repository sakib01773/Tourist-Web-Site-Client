                        <p>We help people travel better by connecting curious travelers with exceptional local guides, worldwide. Our mission is to curate the best experiences from every country people travel to.

                        What started as an idea in June 2006 became our company in November 2008.
                        After an experience visiting the Great Wall of China and meeting some local women who shared some in depth history of the wall in exchange for local souvenirs, Paul and Dave started to think about how to give these women a platform where they can safely connect with travellers to deliver tours that share their vast local knowledge, and be compensated appropriately for it.

                        Out of this, ToursByLocals was launched from our head office in Vancouver, BC. We now also have offices in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and Glasgow (Scotland). This allows us to provide 24 hour customer support to our travellers and guides, seven days a week.

                        <p>our talented team recruits and selects the very best guides around the world. Only after successfully meeting our criteria and reference checks are they allowed to post their tours and profiles on our site. We have over 4700 phenomenal guides in more than 180 countries!

                        We have thousands of tours on our site ready for you to book online (or by phone) any time. Don’t see exactly what you’re looking for? Contact the guides directly to create a fully customised private tour to suit your needs, then book and pay for that tour online. All of our tours are fully private and customisable.

                        All of the professional guides on our site are responsible for:

                        - setting their own pricing
                        - determining their availability
                        - arranging transportation
                        - selecting tour start times
                        - organizing the itinerary.</p>

                        <p>No. You do not need to tip your guide; it is not expected. However, the guide may accept a tip, if offered.

                            All the guides set their tour prices to ensure they are appropriately compensated for their time. As such they do not rely on tips from tours.

                            All guides are aware of this policy.

                            If you would like to help your guide, you can leave a thoughtful review of your tour for future travellers to see.</p>
